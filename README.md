# popular_movies_p1

In this project, I utilized theMovieDB's API to fetch movie data and populated a sortable GridView with a custom adapter to display the movies. Tapping a movie in the GridView triggers the onClickListener that starts a new activity containing a fragment with more information about the movie.

I am also in the process of implementing a ContentProvider and appropriate Loaders to populate the fragments.
